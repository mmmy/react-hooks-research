Ethereum-as-a-parachain: Trust-free bridge to Ethereum and back again, allowing posted transactions to be routed from parachains into Ethereum (and treated like any other transaction of external origin) and allow Ethereum contracts to be able to post transactions to parachains and the accounts therein. Initially, this will be modelled to ascertain feasibility and get any structural limitations based around the number of validators required by the consensus process, a component on which it is dependent. A proof-of-concept can be built following this and final development will be dependent on the relay-chain itself. Bitcoin-RPC compatibility layer: A simple RPC compatibility layer for the relay-chain allowing infrastructure already built using that protocol to be interoperable with Polkadot and as such minimise effort for support. A stretch goal requiring the relay-chain.
